### About
I genuinely enjoy programming, especially the thinking that comes before writing code.

I like breaking problems down, exploring different approaches,  
and understanding how things work rather than treating them as black boxes.

I’m currently building my foundations in full-stack development,  
with a focus on learning concepts deeply and writing code with intent.

---

### Current Technical Focus
- Full-stack fundamentals (backend logic, data flow, APIs)  
- Core programming concepts and problem-solving  
- Data handling and basic data modeling  
- Writing code to understand, not just to make things work

### Projects

**ClubHub (In progress)**  
An early-stage project to explore full-stack concepts through  
club management, roles, and permissions.  

**ImageOrganiser**  
A practical project built to explore automation and data handling  
by organizing large image collections through explicit rules.
